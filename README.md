# colours-of-the-weather

This is an ongoing project which explores the socially constructed division between technology and nature. 
The installation consists of LED lights, a Raspberry pi and a plexiglass container. The colour, hue and pattern of the LED 
lights change depending on the weather.  It is displayed in nature and perhaps it has no other purpose than to just coexist 
with nature, or even to become part of it. That way the division is blurred and the idea of technology as a tool solely 
ment to solve the problems of humankind is being questioned. This is a working title and the video is documentation of the 
work, not a finished art piece.
